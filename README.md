2. **Data Cleaning:** We'll check for missing values and perform any necessary data cleaning to ensure the accuracy of our analysis.

3. **Basic Statistics:** We'll compute basic statistical measures, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, to better understand the numerical attributes in the dataset.

4. **Data Visualization:** We'll use various visualization techniques to create insightful plots, including pie charts, bar plots, scatter plots, and 3D visualizations.

5. **Correlation Analysis:** We'll examine correlations between different attributes, such as pitchers' asking valuation and actual deal valuation.

6. **Success Rates and Equity Analysis:** We'll analyze the success rates of deals made by different sharks and explore the relationships between equity offered, deal amounts, and pitchers' asking valuations.

7. **Comparing Successful and Unsuccessful Pitches:** We'll compare the average valuations of successful and unsuccessful pitches to identify any trends.
